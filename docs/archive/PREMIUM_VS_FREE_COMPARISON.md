   - 1000 FREE users → 3.5 refs/user avg = 3,500 new signups
   - 10% become Premium = 350 new paid users
   - 350 × 999k = 349,650,000 VNĐ ARR

2. **Community Building:**
   - Active Telegram group (engagement)
   - User-generated content (social proof)
   - Brand advocates (organic marketing)

3. **Data & Insights:**
   - Anonymized user behavior patterns
   - Product improvement insights
   - Market research data

4. **Premium Feeder:**
   - 1.7% FREE → Premium conversion
   - 1000 FREE → 17 Premium = 16,983,000 VNĐ ARR

**FREE User Value:**
```
Referral value: 3.5 refs × 10% Premium conversion × 999k
= ~350k indirect ARR per FREE user over 2 years
```
